# Description

Hi all ðŸ‘‹

Here is my test carried out in Elixir. This is my first time with Elixir.
It took me time to discover the language and learn the different concepts. I have a lot of questions ðŸ™‚

The sources are present in the `lib` folder and the tests in the `test` folder.

In order to provide clean code, I used few tools (formatter, `dialyzer`, test, github actions). I also tried `credo`

I've split my work into several Pull Requests. You can therefore easily see the evolution of the project in these different PRs.

# Prerequisites

- Install Elixir (v1.14.4). See https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

- Validates the installation using `elixir --version`. It should return something like:

```
Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:12:12] [ds:12:12:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns] [dtrace]

Elixir 1.14.4 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)
```

- The project uses `mix` as build tool. Run `mix deps.get` to install the dependencies.

- `rebar` is needed to build the project dependencies (`telemetry` used by `plug_cowboy`).
  You may need to install it by running `mix local.rebar`

# How to run the application?

- Simply run `mix run` (This command starts a web server on `:8080`)

- Open a web browser to http://localhost:8080

# How to run the tests?

- Simply run `mix test` (This command outputs the test result and the test coverage)

# How to run Dialyzer?

This project uses [Dialyzer](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html) (via https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir)

You can simply run `mix dialyzer` to launch it.

# Scaling

# Notes/Questions

- Why dialyzer does not complain?

```
  @spec test3() :: list(integer())
  def test3() do
    [%{name: "toto", brand: "toto"}] |> Enum.map(& &1)
  end
```

I noticed that a lib called `TypeCheck` exists for Elixir. Do you recommend it?

- How to properly handle errors in the Elixir application?

- I know that it would be possible to create different processes to separate the concerns.
  As this is my first time with Elixir, I really would like to discuss it with Elixir experts
  to gather feedback about the current version and understand how processes can help.
